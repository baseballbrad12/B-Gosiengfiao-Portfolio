     <p>
        My name is Bradley Gosiengfiao, and I am currently a Financial Analyst in the Aerospace and Defense Industry.
        I graduated from UC Irvine with a BS in Business Economics, and I look forward to continuing my Anteater Career with this bootcamp!
        <br>

        </br>
        I was born in San Ramon, CA, where I lived for over 20 years of my life. Growing up in a bubble community, my main focuses in my early years were video games, guitar, and especially baseball. My parents were very supportive and I always planned on attending a four year college, however, I chose to save money through attending commnunity college, and play collegiate baseball.
        <br>

        </br>
        After 2 years playing baseball and finishing my general education, I was accepted in the Business Economics program at UC Irvine. This was a tremendous lifestyle shift because, suddenly, home was not so close. It was a tough transition going from a focused collegiate athlete, living at home, to a regular, academic driven student. The biggest adjustment for me was time management because, as a student-athlete, my classes were always determined for me; along with workouts, practices, and homework, playing sports gave me a set schedule. It was truly time for me to grow as an independent.
        <br>
        
        </br>
        I am so happy to have my degree, especially in Business Economics and from a school I really enjoyed attending. As we grow, our focuses change, and I as I grew I didn't stop to think about what truly fulfills me. I am enthralled to learn coding languages because what truly makes me happy is working on projects where I see progress, and a start to finish. That is my root motivation for coding, but also, I am excited in gaining the technical skills that will support my creativity and opportunity in the future. I look forward to finishing this bootcamp with potential of changing my career to software development.
